    "__Task:__ Light, like water, behaves both as a particle and as a wave. That is, light is comprised of individual particles called photons (analogous to drops of water). Their collective behavior is wave-like. Waves can be described by several characteristics, including their 'wavelength', which is the distance from crest to adjacent crest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sound also behaves like a wave. You may have noticed that a siren sounds different when an ambulance is coming towards you versus when it's driving away. That's because the motion of the ambulance relative to you causes the waves to either bunch up closer together (as it moves toward you), or to spread out as it drives away. This is called the Doppler effect. When it happens to light, it's also called red- and blue-shift. \n",
    "\n",
    "The more a lightwave is scrunched together or pulled apart due to the motion of the object emitting the light towards the observer, the greater the difference will be between its true wavelength and the wavelength the observer sees. In other words, the faster an ambulance drives, the more noticeable the Doppler effect will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Astrochemists rely on the fact that lots of common sources of light have known, true wavelengths that we can measure on Earth. They can therefore compare true and observed light wavelengths to determine the redshift and velocity of galaxies emitting light. \n",

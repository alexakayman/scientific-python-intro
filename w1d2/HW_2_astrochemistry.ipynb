    "__Task:__ As an astrochemist, you'll be working with large datasets describing the observed and true wavelengths of many, many different kinds of spectral lines. Suppose you are studying a host galaxy and you'd like to determine its redshift and velocity. The host galaxy's spectrum has many spectral lines, and for each of them, you can use their known and observed wavelength to determine a redshift. The problem is that real data is often noisy, so these might not all give exactly the same final result. \n",

    "Write a loop that calculates the redshift and velocity of the host galaxy for each spectral line individually. \n",

    "Then, once the loop is complete, average the resulting redshifts and velocities to find a best guess estimate of the true answer. \n",
